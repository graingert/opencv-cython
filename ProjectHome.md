This wrapper is automatically generated from the C header, by the mean of GCC-XML.

The wrapper includes transparent mapping in-between pointers types, and structured types  of OpenCV, and numpy arrays.

The Wrapper has been tested with openCV 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, OpenCV 2.0,
under Windows and under Linux, for 32bits and 64bits system.

As the wrapper is automatically generated, the syntax is exactly similar as the C version.

All structures within the C Code also exist as class in Python, and all the function that uses such kind of structure has first arguments are available as method.

As a maintainer, I am sorry but I am very busy right now, I have no the time to work of binary distribution for all version of windows and linux. However, you contribution are welcome.

Note that the latest version of this package is currently available as part of the PyCVF
source tree. Moreover, if you are interested by python and computer vision, PyCVF should be an interesting projec you should follow / contribute to.
